# SINGULARITY.CONF
# This is the global configuration file for Singularity. This file controls
# what the container is allowed to do on a particular host, and as a result
# this file must be owned by root.


# ALLOW PID NS: [BOOL]
# Should we disable the PID namespace always? This maybe desirable for
# resources that are scheduled with non CGroups enabled resource managers.
allow pid ns = yes

# ALLOW USER SCRATCH: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we allow users to specify scratch directories on the command line?
# NOTE: Regardless of this setting, if the host kernel is too old (doesn't
# support PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS) to allow this to be done safely, this
# feature is disabled.
allow user scratch = yes

# ALLOW SETUID: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid binary for launching singularity?
# The majority of features require this to be set to yes, but newer Fedora and
# Ubuntu kernels can provide limited functionality in unprivileged mode.
allow setuid = yes

# MOUNT PROC: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we automatically mount /proc within the container?
mount proc = yes


# MOUNT SYS: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we automatically mount /sys within the container?
mount sys = yes


# MOUNT HOME: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# Should we automatically determine the calling user's home directory and
# attempt to mount it's base path into the container?
mount home = yes


# BIND PATH: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# Define a list of files/directories that should be made available from within
# the container. The file or directory must exist within the container on
# which to attach to. you can specify a different source and destination
# path (respectively) with a comma; otherwise source and dest are the same.
#bind path = /etc/singularity/default-nsswitch.conf, /etc/nsswitch.conf
bind path = /etc/resolv.conf
bind path = /etc/hosts
bind path = /dev
bind path = /tmp
bind path = /var/tmp


# BIND SCRATCH: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# Define a list of directories that should be overridden with an empty
# directory.  This allows for private, writable directories that might
# otherwise be shared system directories (such as /tmp).
#
# NOTE: These directories are applied after 'bind path' directives and
# are applied even when in "contain mode".
#
# bind scratch = /tmp
# bind scratch = /var/tmp


# CONFIG PASSWD: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# If /etc/passwd exists within the container, this will automatically append
# an entry for the calling user
config passwd = yes


# CONFIG GROUP: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: yes
# If /etc/group exists within the container, this will automatically append
# an entry for the calling user
config group = yes


# MOUNT SLAVE: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: no
# Should we automatically propogate filesystem changes from the host?
# This should be set to 'yes' when autofs mounts in the system should
# show up in the container.
mount slave = no

# OVERLAY DIR: [STRING] 
# DEFAULT: (disabled) 
# Directory used to mount the portions for overlay.  If unspecified, overlay is not 
# used 
overlay dir = /var/singularity/overlay 

# CONTAINER DIR: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: /var/singularity/mnt
# Where does the container mount namespace begin from (e.g. where the container
# gets mounted while in use)
container dir = /var/singularity/mnt


# SESSIONDIR PREFIX: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: /tmp/.singularity-session-
# This specifies the prefix for the session directory. Appended to this string
# is an identification string unique to each user and container. If /tmp is
# not reasonable for your environment, another suggestion could be:
#sessiondir prefix = /var/singularity/sessions/

# SCRATCH DIR: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# When empty scratch directories (such as a per-container /tmp) are created
# to support the 'bind scratch' directive, they will be stored in the directory
# specified here.  If this is undefined (default), then the following locations
# will be tried:
# - $_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR
# - $TMPDIR
# - /tmp
#scratch dir = /var/singularity/scratch/

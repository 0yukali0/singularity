Singularity is a portable application stack packaging and runtime utility.

There are several methods to implement portable application stacks at
present. Among them are containers and virtual machines. When using these
solutions to package a single application (or application stack), one ends
up having to manage the entire operating system overhead (security, updates,
size/bulk, etc..) just to distribute a single application or workflow. While
virtual machines and containers have strong usage benefits, application
portability and distribution is not an effecient use of these technologies.

Singularity works on a completely different perspective. Contrary to building
and managing an entire operating system environment (for the sake of
portability and reproducibility of an application stack), Singularity works
on the opposite premis. By configuration of an application stack spec via a
configuration file, coupled with automatic dependency resolution to achieve
portability, Singularity can create minimalistic singlet "app" which can
easily be copied from system to systemand run using Singularity on different
systems.

In a manner of speaking, this is an OS X style application framework for
Linux.

Singularity provides two primary functions:

1. SINGULARITY-BUILD
    This is the package build tool which is responsible for creating the
    Singularity Application (.sapp) package which can be run as a standalone
    program. The process of building a .sapp package is determined by a
    configuration which defines what components of the underlying environment
    should be included and how to run those components. Additionally, it
    scans the application to identify the runtime dependencies for OS level
    portability.

    The .sapp package could be built to run exactly as it would normally be
    called on the command line environment (e.g. arguments, files, IO, etc..)
    or it could be packaged to be completely self contained. For example, it
    could be reasonable for someone to want to package a web server with
    their web application already bundled within a single .sapp file. To
    start the entire application stack, you simply run the .sapp file through
    Singularity (and thus it could start PostgreSQL, Apache, from within the
    environment).

2. SINGULARITY (runtime)
    The Singularity application itself understands how to read a .sapp
    package and executes the portable runtime environment. As mentioned above,
    the package itself could be built in a manner to emulate the standard
    runtime arguments of a standalone binary, or it could run the entire
    application package in a self contained manner.

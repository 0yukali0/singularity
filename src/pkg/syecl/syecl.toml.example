# Singularity crypto verified container ECL config file
#
# This file describes the domains (path names) in which container files are
# authorized execution. The decision is made by validating both the location
# of the container file in the file system and the signing authority of said
# container.
#
# Example:
#
#activated = true
#
#[[execgroup]]
#  dirpath = "/var/cache/containers"
#  keyfp = ["5994BE54C31CF1B5E1994F987C52CF6D055F072B","7064B1D6EFF01B1262FED3F03581D99FE87EAFD1"]
#  mode = "whitelist"
#  tagname = "group1"
#
#[[execgroup]]
#  dirpath = "/tmp/containers"
#  keyfp = ["7064B1D6EFF01B1262FED3F03581D99FE87EAFD1"]
#  mode = "whitelist"
#  tagname = "group2"
#
# The above example defines 2 execution groups (dirpath: /var/cache/containers
# and /tmp/containers), in which only containers signed with Key IDs 055F072B and
# E87EAFD1 may run if started from /var/cache/containers and only container
# signed with Key ID E87EAFD1 may run is started from /tmp/containers.

Features:
    * Add option to bind cwd if not already bound
    * Move tmp bind mounts to separate module, so when -C is passed it can
        use sessiondir
    * Change default behavior for PID namespace sharing
    * Support tgz image format

Fixes:
    * Fix the conditional /proc mounting (move kernelfs to happen before
        chroot)
    * For older distros that do not support loop autoclear, conditionally
        create a child process and move mount namespace to a child process,
            and have parent umount when done
    * Support legacy containers

New API porting:
    * signal handlers
    * helper programs
    * tmpfs overlay
    * Clean old sources

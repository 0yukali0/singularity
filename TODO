Features:
    * Add option to bind cwd if not already bound
    * Move tmp bind mounts to separate module, so when -C is passed it can
        use sessiondir
    * Change default behavior for PID namespace sharing
    * Support tgz image format
    * --with-userns configure flag needs to be changed to enable/disable
        suid compoents

Fixes:
    * For older distros that do not support loop autoclear, conditionally
        create a child process and move mount namespace to a child process,
        and have parent umount when done
    * Go over singularity.conf and finish adding features back in

New API porting:
    * signal handlers
    * tmpfs overlay
    * scratch directory creation
    * clean old sources

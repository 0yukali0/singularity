Features:
    * Add option to bind cwd if not already bound
    * Support tgz image format
    * Add support for user defined bind points (config option already present)
    * Refactor create and bootstrap

Fixes:
    * Go over singularity.conf and finish adding features back in

New API porting:
    * signal handlers
    * make loop device multi-process compatible
    * clean old sources
    * port the rest of the binaries to API and link them shared


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

Signal handler API update to be more OO like and support ad-hoc forking:
    * struct singularity_signal singularity_signal_handler_init(); //presently now pre_fork()?
    * singularity_signal_handler_child(struct singularity_signal)
    * singularity_signal_handler_parent(struct singularity_signal)
    * singularity_signal_handler_wait(struct singularity_signal) // Maybe this can be merged with *_parent()?
    * singularity_signal_handler_child_destroy(struct singularity_signal) // Is this necessary?
    * singularity_signal_handler_parent_destroy(struct singularity_signal) // Is this necessary?

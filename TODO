General:

Singularity-build:
    - Support a mechanism for staging data (intput and output)
    - Test to make sure a specfile is a specfile before building
    - If sensitive files (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts) is in %files,
      should we trust it? Request from:
      https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity/issues/16

Singularity-install:
    - Lock on installs (mkdir ...; flock until done)


Singularity-run:
    - Support archiving output
    - Standardize on an output data location
    - Exec'ing container does a "s install; s run.." and leaves cached
    - Running container.sapp should work

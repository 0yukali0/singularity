USAGE: singularity (options) build [SAPP specfile] (SAPP target)

Build a SAPP file from a specfile template. The specfile has a basic sytax
including key-value pairs of the following declarations:

    Name:       Define the name of the SAPP pacakge. If this is omitted
                then the name is derived from the name of the specfile.
                note: this should not have spaces or other non-file name
                happy characters.
    Exec:       The primary binary or script that will be exec'ed when this
                SAPP envrionment is run.
    Maintainer: The free form name and email address of the SAPP maintainer
                or developer that created this package.

The specfile also supports sections which are defined and delinated by
section names which are defined by a percent sign ('%'). The section will
include all following lines until either the end of the file or the next
section. Supported section names are as follows:

    %files      This should be a list of all files from the host operating
                system that should be bundled into the SAPP envrionment.
                All of the programs, data, configurations, and files that
                you need to run should be listed.
    %runscript  The runscript is the driver which gets exec'ed when the
                SAPP bundle is run. Iff you have defined an "Exec:"
                declaration above, then by default this written for you.
                Using this feature, you can either rewrite the default
                behavior or if you have chosen not to define "Exec:"
                then this section would be required. This section will
                be executed as a shell script within the SAPP
                envrionment (container) thus standard shell syntax is
                not only supported but required. 

SPECFILE EXAMPLE:
    This is a basic example which creates a SAPP package that will
    perform a simple search for any networking protocols or ports
    contained in /etc/services. Simple pass the argument(s) you
    wish to search for in the command line arguments of the SAPP
    execution.

    Name: service
    Exec: /bin/grep
    Maintianer: Gregory M. Kurtzer <gmk@lbl.gov>
    %files
    /etc/services
    %runscript
    for i in $@; do
        grep "$i" /etc/services
    done

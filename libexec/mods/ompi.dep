# OpenMPI dynamically loads plugin libraries from a
# directory located under its install prefix. As these
# libraries are only loaded after start of execution, we
# cannot detect them with strace - therefore, we have to
# manually slurp them up here.
#
# OpenMPI's help system also relies on a set of text files
# that contain all the verbose help messages. While these
# aren't technically required (as they are only used in
# cases of abnormal termination), users generally prefer to
# have the clearer explanations, so slurp those up too
#
# Finally, we pickup /usr/bin/ssh. This is only required for
# the case where someone executes "singularity run mycontainer"
# as MPI interprets this as a singleton, which means we have
# to setup a daemon within the container to "shepherd" the
# singleton. The daemon requires access to ssh for those
# cases where the user calls MPI_Comm_spawn and wants to
# launch a secondary job on additional nodes.

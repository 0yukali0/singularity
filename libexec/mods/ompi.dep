# OpenMPI dynamically loads plugin libraries from a
# directory located under its install prefix. As these
# libraries are only loaded after start of execution, we
# cannot detect them with strace - therefore, we have to
# manually slurp them up here.
#
# OpenMPI's help system also relies on a set of text files
# that contain all the verbose help messages. While these
# aren't technically required (as they are only used in
# cases of abnormal termination), users generally prefer to
# have the clearer explanations, so slurp those up too
